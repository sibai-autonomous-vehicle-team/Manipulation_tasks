#Metaworld Environment Wrapper

##Installation

```bash
conda create -n MW_Research python=3.9
conda activate MW_Research

conda install numpy
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
pip instal gymnasium

#If you encounter sympy conflicts with PyTorch
pip install sympy==1.13.1
```
MW.py
Wrapper class for Metaworld environment "pick-place-wall-v2". Adds collision detection and calculates cost based on whether there was a collision or not
Capture_MW_1.py
Records robots trajectories and saves training data. Uses built in policy SawyerPickPlaceWallV2Policy (Metaworld built in policy), change for actual randomized data
Records state, action, and cost into a csv format

MW_1.py and Capture_MW.py create same results based on "pick-out-of-hole-v2" environment within Metaworld. Have a cost function that will return a cost of 0.8 if the end effector collides with the imaginary cone that Metaworld has created that object needs to be reached out of. Actual hole is a box when you render the environment but Metaworld created an imaginary cone that the robot so that the robot has to grab the object from above so collision detection was built in with that 

MW.py and MW_1.py were created to replicate results generated by formulaone.py within dreamer training with safety-gymnasium

parsing_data.py is for going through all of the data and returning which steps had a non-zero cost associated with them
